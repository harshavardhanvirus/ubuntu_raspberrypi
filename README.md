# ubuntu_raspberrypi
This tool can be used to share the screen of linux arm64 OS or linux amd64 in windows

Download the tools from the repo and store the share_host in the linux machine and store the share_client in the windows machine

Make sure both the machine are in the same network.

Run the share_host in the linux machine and run the share_client in the windows machine

In the windows machine UI enter the raspberry pi IP in the text box and click on start

The windows machine UI will show you the display of raspberry pi

Note - Sometimes due to raspberry pi being headerless there would no display output when it is not connected to display in which case it would be difficullt to obtain the data hence to solve this we can connect the raspberry pi to a VGA which will sove the issue.
